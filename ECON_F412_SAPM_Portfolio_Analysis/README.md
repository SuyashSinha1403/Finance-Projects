- Estimated required rate of return demanded by shareholders
- Evaluated stock performance from a risk–reward perspective
- Conducted short-term price–volume and market depth analysis

Part II – Portfolio Analysis
- Constructed a five-stock diversified portfolio across different sectors
- Calculated expected returns, risk, and coefficient of variation for each stock
- Built price-weighted, value-weighted, equal-weighted, and beta-weighted portfolios
- Developed covariance matrix and Markowitz efficient frontier
- Computed Sharpe ratios and compared portfolio performance with the market portfolio
- Discussed implications for the Efficient Market Hypothesis
