This project was completed as part of **ECON / FIN F315 – Financial Management** at BITS Pilani.
The objective of the assignment was to evaluate the financial performance, capital structure,
and overall financial health of a company using historical financial and market data.

The analysis is structured across three major components focusing on cost of capital,
financing decisions, and long-term financial sustainability.
